	<em>May all beings have happiness and the cause of happiness.<br/>
May they be free of suffering and the cause of suffering.<br/>
May they never be disassociated from the supreme happiness which is without suffering.<br/>
May they remain in the boundless equanimity, free from both attachment to close ones and rejection of others.<br/></em>
