title:  Digital Pollock

These are a series of Digital Paintings I experimented with using jacksonpollock.org in 2020 and 2021. 
I set a series of titles as a way to relate my interpretation of the paintings at the time of creation.
The fascinating aspect about this experience was that my love for Pollock (initially non-existent) grew as I kept creating the paintings.
In addition, the digital medium of expression meant a new way to relate to my art, as this was perhaps my first major digital painting endeavor.
This was a fun project that required no skill other than moving the mouse around using a laptop computer. 
I particularly enjoyed the color combinations the algorithm came up with and the various emotions that accompanied it.
